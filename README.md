DEMONSTRATION:

NOTES:

* The Hustle Castle Window must not be maximised, once app is started the window will resize and move to the top left of screen then proceed to dig

* The script will collect rewards on 3 vertical lines, and will continue to dig down on the middle line. (See video demonstration)

* As many people will have thousands of pick axes the script is designed to dig fairly quickly, as a result, from time to time it may miss rewards and continue digging.

* If left unattended it will stop looping/digging after around 4000 pickaxes being used. Didn't want to run it infinitely.

* The script works by matching an image and sends the mouse to click on the result, there is absolutely no tampering with the game. It will also click in random areas just as a human would.

* You cannot use your PC to do other tasks while the script is running, simply because the mouse cursor will be active while the script runs.

* You will likely get a Windows Smartscreen alert the first time you run the tool. This happens because the file is not a widely downloaded app on the internet and therefore does not meet the reputation standards by microsoft. The file is completely safe and won't be flagged as harmful by any antivirus programs.

ISSUES:

* As above mentioned, the script may fail to click on the rewards in time, to resolve this would slow down the script, i may add a slow/fast option but it doesnt happen often enough to be considered a major issue.
